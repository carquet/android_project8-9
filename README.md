# android_project8 stage 1
In this project, we'll design and create the structure of a Inventory App that will allow a store to keep track of its inventory of products. The app will need to store information about the product and allow the user to track sales and shipments and make it easy for the user to order more from the listed supplier.


- Creating a SQLite table in your app
- Populating that table with new entries
- Modifying the entries
- Displaying the contents of the table to users.


# android_project9 stage 2
In this stage, we'll build out the app UI for users to add and remove inventory.

- Storing information in a SQLite database
- Integrating Androidâ€™s file storage systems into that database
- Setting up a Content Provider and use it to access a repository of data
- Presenting information from files and SQLite databases to users
- Updating information based on user input
- Creating intents to other apps using stored information
